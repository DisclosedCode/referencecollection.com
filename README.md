### About

Designed to accelerate your coding journey by providing clear and descriptive references for various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Our goal is to make coding accessible and efficient for everyone, from beginners to advanced developers.

### How it started

Throughout my professional career and education. Whenever I explored a new programming language, I developed the habit of creating a reference file with the same extension as the language.
In this file, I documented the language's basic, intermediate, and advanced features in a clear and concise manner. This practice enhanced my productivity and provided a quick, accessible way to refresh my knowledge.
I created this repository to share these reference files and continue expanding on them in the same style.
