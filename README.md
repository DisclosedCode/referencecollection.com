### About

Code-based references for various programming languages, frameworks and tools designed to simplify your coding experience by providing practical and focused guides that are constantly updated and refined. All of these references are available at referencecollection.com or directly in the /references/* directory.

### How it started

Throughout my education and career. Whenever I learned a new programming language, I developed the habit of creating a reference file with the same extension as the language. In this file, I documented the language's basic, intermediate, and advanced concepts. This organized approach made it easier for me to quickly review important information and refresh my knowledge. I created this repository to share these reference guides and to keep expanding them in a consistent, accessible format. Additionally, I am working on training AI to help write even better references, enhancing the quality and accessibility of these resources for all developers.
