### About

Code-based references for various programming languages, frameworks and tools designed to simplify your coding experience by providing practical and focused guides that are constantly updated and refined. 
All of these references are available directly in the [reference directory](./references) or at https://referencecollection.com/

### How it started

Over the course of my university studies and professional career, I've developed a habit whenever I start learning a new programming language: I’d create a reference file with the same extension as the language. In this file, I documented everything from basic syntax to advanced features, keeping everything organized so I can easily refresh my knowledge whenever I need to.

I put together this repository and this [website](https://referencecollection.com/) to share these reference guides with others and keep adding new ones in a consistent, easy-to-access format, hoping they’ll be useful for developers looking to quickly grasp key concepts and streamline their learning process.

I’m also working on training AI to help build even better guides. The goal is to make these resources even more useful and accessible for developers of all levels.
